# objc-logger
Objective C Logger with Discord Webhook (Battery, Location, etc...)
# Info
Pretty Simple Location, Battery, UUID Logger for Tweaks, Mod menus, etc. This was created just to trust customers.

THIS PROJECT IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY! NOT TO HARM ANYONE!

Currently Location Logger doesn´t work as it works only if the app has enabled location services but you can enable them by yourself with your code it´s depending on you.

# Additional
espl.h file is from eggshell RAT on github thanks to him else it would be possible
